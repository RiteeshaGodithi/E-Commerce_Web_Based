<h2>
Congratulations!</h2>
If you are viewing this page by accessing the URL http://RiteeshaSujeeth/ or http://localhost/
in a browser, your Blazix server is up and running successfully!
<p>Here are more links to confirm that various pieces of the server are
working correctly.
<h3>
JSP</h3>
In order to have JSP work correctly, the "javac" command must be available
in your PATH (typing "javac" in a Command window should invoke the compiler.)&nbsp;
If it is not, you must add it and reboot the machine, then restart the
server.
<p>If "javac" is already setup correctly, click on the link below to confirm
that JSPs are working correctly.&nbsp; (Note: the first time it will take
a while because the JSP page will be turned into Java and compiled using
javac.)
<blockquote><a href="Jsptest.jsp">JSP Test Page</a></blockquote>

<h3>
Authentication</h3>
The following link demonstrates authentication.&nbsp; Use the username
"test" and the password "testpwd" when asked.&nbsp; You can change the
"application.default.authType" parameter in web.ini to "Basic" and restart
the Blazix server, to see an instance of "Basic" authentication instead
of "Form" authentication.
<blockquote><a href="AuthenticationTest.html">Authentication Sample</a></blockquote>

<h3>
Internationalization</h3>
The link below demonstrates JSP internationalization.&nbsp; View the page
from the link below.&nbsp; Then temporarily change your browser's language
preference to french (the only translation file included with the sample
is for french) and reload the page.&nbsp; You should see the language on
the page change.
<blockquote><a href="I18nsample.jsp">Internationalization Sample</a></blockquote>
HTML internationalization is similar, but instead of only one base file
and multiple translation files, involves maintaining separate HTML files
for each language.&nbsp; The server automatically picks the right language
version if available.
<h3>
WIRELESS</h3>
The installation adds a sample <i>index.wsp</i> file.&nbsp; If you have
access to a WAP-capable wireless device (or a WAP simulator), you can also
confirm that the WSP suffix is available and working correctly by pointing
your wireless device or simulator to the URL http://RiteeshaSujeeth/
<p>Notes:
<ul>
<li>
You may have to enter the IP address rather than the name of your machine
if the machine's hostname is not externally known.</li>

<li>
If you are inside a firewall, the WAP device or WAP simulator will not
be able to get to your machine unless your machine's port 80 is opened
through the firewall.&nbsp; (WAP simulators placed on the same machine,
or at another machine inside the firewall will not have this problem.)</li>

<li>
The first time this page is accessed it will take a little while, because
the WSP page will be turned into Java and compiled using javac.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
What next?</h3>
You can now start adding your own pages.&nbsp; A simple test is to place
an HTML file in <tt>C:\Blazix\webfiles</tt> folder, and view it from the
browser.&nbsp; If you create a file called <tt>C:\Blazix\webfiles\myfile.html</tt>,
it will be accessible from your browser as <a href="http://RiteeshaSujeeth/myfile.html">http://RiteeshaSujeeth/myfile.html</a>
or <a href="http://localhost/myfile.html">http://localhost/myfile.html</a>
<p>If you look in the <tt>web.ini</tt> file in <tt>C:\Blazix</tt>, you will
see that <tt>application.default.dir</tt> attribute has been set to <tt>C:\Blazix\webfiles</tt>
directory.
<p>If you would like to change the directory where you will keep your web
pages, change the <tt>web.ini</tt> file so that "<tt>application.default.dir</tt>"
points to your directory.
<p>See the links on "Getting Started" in the online documentation for further
suggestions on getting started with the Blazix server.</td>
